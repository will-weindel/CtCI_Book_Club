//Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.

//I - two strings
//O - bool
//C - check for other data types, strs of diff length
//E - spaces? empty strings

//D - hash / obj
//A/P - linear (using sucessive for loops)

const checkPermutations = (str1, str2) => {
  //Please code here
};
